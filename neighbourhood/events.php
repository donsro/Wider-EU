<h2>Events</h2>
<p>An interesting discussion of how the EU could interface positively with transitional events in the MENA region was given in the Financial Times on 7 February 2011: <strong>A European Date with Arab History</strong>. It argued that the EU's response template should be similar to that used to support the democratic revolutions in central/eastern Europe from 1989 onwards. These were made irreversible through European economic aid, market access, technical assistance, institution building, twinning, seeing-is-believing/people-to-people programmes and development of civil society.</p>
<p>That said, a <a href="http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/pb_grant_neighbourhood_11march11.pdf">report</a> by Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform (CER) commented that the ongoing changes in MENA countries have exposed the failings of the EU's  neighbourhood policy which, to date, has tended to entrench autocracy rather than foster democracy. Grant urged the EU to: offer its neighbours more money, markets and mobility tied to progress on democracy and human rights; invite neighbours to take part in EU foreign policy; support a customs' union in the Mediterranean; and make EU neighbourhood policy less technocratic and more political. He concluded that Turkey is an example, though an imperfect one, for the Arab countries to follow. However, Norman Stone disagreed that the Turkish model is appropriate: see his 5 April 2011 article in The Times - <strong>This Spring won't breed any more Turkeys</strong>.) Further, David Gardner's FT article of 7 June 2011, <strong>Turkey offers stability to stormy region</strong>, commented on a diplomatic by-product of the Arab Spring - Turkey's "zero problems with the neighbours" foreign policy. Turkey now sees itself surrounded by uprisings. Syria, a key part of an integrated regional economy, has been a cold reality check for Turkish policy and Middle East politics.</p> 
<p>Timothy Garton Ash's article in the Guardian on 18 May 2011, <strong>Obama can now define the third great project of the Euro-Atlantic partnership</strong>, listed the first two as: <cite>the reconstruction of western Europe after 1945, symbolised by the Marshall Plan, the founding of Nato, the Council of Europe and the institutions that would eventually develop into today's EU; and the integration of central and eastern Europe into the "Euro-Atlantic structures".</cite> Garton Ash argued that the third great project of transatlantic partnership must be to <cite>help the Arab Spring become a lasting freedom summer for the whole of the Islamic world</cite>.</p>
