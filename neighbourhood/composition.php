<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>Wider Europe is currently made up of 54 countries - the EU itself (28), EU candidate countries (5), potential candidate countries (3), countries in the Middle East and North Africa (11, including Mauritania), as well as Russia and other immediate countries of the former Soviet Union (7). With a total population approaching 1 billion people, a major youth bulge and a substantial combined GDP, Europe's Neighbourhood today is a key player facing major challenges.</p>
<p>The EU's concept of Wider Europe and its European Neighbourhood Policy was presented in a European Commission communication to the European Council and European Parliament on 11 March 2003: (Neighbourhood - A New Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours). It argued that further enlargement of the EU would:</p>
<ol>
    <li>increase fundamentally the political, geographic and economic weight of the EU on the European continent;</li>
    <li>change the shape of the EU's political and economic relations with other parts of the world; and</li>
    <li>give new impetus to the effort of drawing closer to the 385 million inhabitants of countries on the EU's external land and sea borders.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the current EU candidate and potential candidate countries, the European Neighbourhood also includes the Middle East countries (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinian National Authority and Syria, including the League of Arab States), and the countries of North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Mauritania). (Given current instability, it also includes de facto Yemen, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.)</p>
<p>Further countries in the immediate European Neighbourhood include those that were part of the former Soviet Union: Russia, as well as some of its near abroad - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and the Ukraine.</p>
<p> Relevant to all of this is the operation of:</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.eeas.europa.eu/euromed/index_en.htm">the Union for the Mediterranean</a></li> 
</ul>

    <li><a href="http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/people/knicolaidis/finalreport.pdf">Project Europe 2030, Challenges and Opportunities (Reflection Group chaired by Felipe Gonzalez Marquez)</a></li> 
</ul>
<p>Related to this, the (amending) Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 January 2010. It aims to make the enlarged EU of 27 members work better by: establishing simpler, clearer rules for decision-making; streamlining the EU's foreign policy machinery; and giving EU institutions a greater role in police and justice co-operation.</p>
