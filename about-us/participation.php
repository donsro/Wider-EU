<h2>Participation</h2> 
<p>WIDER EUROPE encourages transition in the European Neighbourhood, working with civil society to implement small-scale, start-up projects. These may address economic, social, environmental or geo-political issues, involving participants from the public, private and third sectors, as well as the fourth estate. Major beneficiaries are today's young people who live within the European Neighbourhood - its future citizens, voters, parents, employers, employees, media and politicians.</p>
<p>WIDER EUROPE currently cooperates with three NGOs: <a href="http://www.widereurope.eu/eui">European Initiative (UK)</a>, New Link With Europe (Kosovo) and European Initiative (Montenegro). Together, they work closely with young people, community leaders, businesses, NGOs and the media, as well as central and local governments, to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>create sustainable livelihoods through urban and rural community renewal and regeneration;</li>
    <li>help citizens to apply the principles of area-based community-driven development using output-based budgeting;</li>
    <li>assist local communities to create SMEs and encourage social entrepreneurship with which to establish non-state employment opportunities;</li>
    <li>promote cross-border cooperation, particularly in conflict and post-conflict affected areas; and</li>
    <li>improve local governance as a way of assisting ordinary people to achieve their basic human rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three organisations are actively looking to cooperate with similar NGOs and local/international CSO networks in Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Cyprus and Turkey, as well as in the EU and elsewhere in the European neighbourhood. </p>
