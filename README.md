<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3><a href="http://widereurope.eu" target="_blank">widereurope.eu</a></h3>
<p>Despite the continuously changing dynamics of the European Union, we at WIDER EUROPE want the EU to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be enlarged further by admitting as member states Turkey, the Balkan countries and Iceland, as well as the Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, once they have met the accession criteria;</li>
<li>interact fully with its European neighbourhood, (the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Russia and countries where it has strong influence), which, with a population approaching 1 billion, a major youth bulge and a substantial combined GDP, is a key player that faces major challenges; and</li>
<li>engage more with young people so they can help determine future European policies and actions that both reflect important global issues and take account of key stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>We at WIDER EUROPE also want Britain to remain in the EU, and play a leading, positive role in making the EU more competitive in tomorrow's global market, including the creation of an EU/USA trade alliance that would cover half the world's economic output and more than a third of all trade flows. Details about why Britain should remain within the EU are summarised on British Influence.</p>
