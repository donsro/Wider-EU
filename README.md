# Wider Europe


### [ widereurope.eu ] ( http://widereurope.eu )


Despite the continuously changing dynamics of the European Union, we at WIDER EUROPE want the EU to:


- be enlarged further by admitting as member states Turkey, the Balkan countries and Iceland, as well as the Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, once they have met the accession criteria;
- interact fully with its European neighbourhood, (the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Russia and countries where it has strong influence), which, with a population approaching 1 billion, a major youth bulge and a substantial combined GDP, is a key player that faces major challenges; and
- engage more with young people so they can help determine future European policies and actions that both reflect important global issues and take account of key stakeholders.

We at WIDER EUROPE also want Britain to remain in the EU, and play a leading, positive role in making the EU more competitive in tomorrow's global market, including the creation of an EU/USA trade alliance that would cover half the world's economic output and more than a third of all trade flows. Details about why Britain should remain within the EU are summarised on British Influence.
