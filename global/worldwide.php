<p>Whilst today's political drama is soon forgotten in favour of tomorrow's diplomatic crisis, certain global and international issues remain ongoing thorns in Society’s side.</p>
<p>Examples relevant to Wider Europe, future EU Enlargement and the present European Neighbourhood Policy include (but are not limited to): arms' exports to "blood" destinations; increasing global domination of Chinese interests; the role of civil society; climate change and environmental issues; the challenges of cyberspace; the ongoing Euro financial crisis (particularly in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Cyprus); the importance of governance, especially in Africa; new growth markets; the Gulf Cooperation Council; the world’s hot spots; the increasing importance of oil supplies; and the fragile access that many people have to limited water supplies.</p>
