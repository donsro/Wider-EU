<h2>Civil Society</h2>
<p>Democratic government is relatively new in some countries of Wider Europe. Sometimes, countries have to build everything from the beginning, particularly in post-conflict environments e.g. Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Government may face difficulties in drafting laws and policies, and implementing regulations that meet the needs of its citizens. Civil society organizations (CSOs), if they exist, often lack the capacity to participate in public policy debate and development. Civil society engagement in democratic policy-making requires: increasing the capacity of CSOs to influence policy-making; assisting them to take actions that will shape policy; promoting debate within civil society about the process of drafting laws and public policies; and increasing awareness of public authorities of the need to create an environment for participatory democracy. Open societies need to strengthen government institutions, as well as increase the rights of minorities, develop civic participation, build up international ties (particularly with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/tenders/support-for-civil-society/civil-society-facility/index_en.htm">Europe</a>), develop governance and increase access to education at all levels. Government institutions have to be helped to prevent corruption. Leaders in new democracies include young journalists, police officers, government administrators, political party staff, business community leaders, civil society activists and local members of international organizations.</p>
