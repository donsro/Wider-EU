<h2>GIPSI</h2>
<p>Europe's GIPSI economies have been seriously weakened by the ongoing Euro crisis, with Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy being ranked badly (according to the severity of their credit risk) relative to the Eurozone's "Triple A" countries. Sketchy phrases are bandied about: one size fits none; decoupling; systemic Eurozone problems; Stability and Growth Pact has teeth - but false ones; Greek (and Cypriot) accident waiting to happen - when, not if; extend and pretend. Two key questions are: Will the Euro break up? and Will Germany continue to lead the EU?</p>
