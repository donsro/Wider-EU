<h2>Growers</h2>
<p>There are different groupings of growth economies: the  BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa; MIKT - Mexico, Indonesia, (South) Korea and Turkey; and the Next Eleven (N11) - Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam. These countries all have high potential to become the world's largest growing economies in the 21st century. (Goldman Sachs) criteria used to define them include macroeconomic stability, political maturity, openness of trade, investment policies and education quality, as well as country size and demographics. Critical to further global growth is completion of the Doha Round of world trade negotiations. Launched in November 2001 and named the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dda_e/dda_e.htm">Doha Development Agenda</a>, this round of trade negotiations is broader than past global trade negotiations, and specifically targeted at addressing the needs of developing countries. The focus of negotiations has been on: reforming agricultural subsidies; improving access to global markets; and ensuring that new liberalisation in the global economy respects the need for sustainable economic growth in developing countries. Whilst the successful conclusion of the Doha negotiations would confirm the central role of multilateral liberalisation and rule-making, and confirm the WTO as a powerful shield against protectionist backsliding, the most recent round of negotiations, 23-29 July 2008, broke down after failing to reach a compromise on agricultural import rules. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/eu-and-wto/doha/">EU's objectives for the Doha Round</a> are: market access for the industrial goods sector; improvement to, and clarification of, the WTO rulebook on subsides that distort the production of industrial goods; and, for the agriculture sector, an agreement that reforms farm subsidy programmes throughout the rich world in line with the EU's wide-ranging 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
