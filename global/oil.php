<h2>Oil</h2>
<p>Permanent high oil prices could weaken trade balances, add to inflation, put pressure on central banks to raise interest rates, and derail the global economic recovery. To offset supply disruption, oil can be released from emergency stocks, of which OECD countries hold 1.6bn barrels. Current prices are not yet near the all-time high of US$147.02 for Brent crude (July 2008). Any shortfall on global markets could be offset in principle by increased output from Saudi Arabia.</p>
