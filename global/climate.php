<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Environmental issues are critical today, particularly those that relate to climate change. Over a decade ago, most countries joined an international treaty - the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a> - to start considering what to do to reduce global warming, and cope with future temperature increases. The UN Climate Change Conference held in Durban in 2011 sought to establish a new treaty to limit carbon emissions. It agreed to a legally binding deal comprising all countries, to be prepared by 2015 and take effect in 2020. There was progress regarding the creation of a Green Climate Fund to distribute US$100 billion per year to help poor countries adapt to climate change impacts.</p>

<p>International negotiators at the December 2014 UN climate change talks in Lima agreed on a plan to fight global warming that would for the first time commit all countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The plan was hailed as an important first step towards a climate change deal due to be finalised in Paris in 2015. Campaigners said the plan was far too weak to limit warming to the internationally agreed limit of 2C above pre-industrial levels, or to protect poor countries from climate change.</p>
