<h2>Arms Exports</h2>
<p>Concerning arms sales, the UK's Export Control Organisation is responsible for legislating, assessing and issuing export and trade licences for specific categories of "controlled" goods. This encompasses items that include so-called dual-use goods, torture goods and radioactive sources, as well as military items. Whether a licence is required depends on factors that include the items proposed for export and any sanctions in force on the export destination. If items exported from the UK are controlled, a licence is needed to export legally. Exporters are responsible for complying with the law, understanding the regulations and keeping themselves informed. Everything granted a license is categorised. Licences can be revoked. Which countries have sold weapons and riot control equipment that are being used against today's protesters? If arms have to be exported, is it preferable to sanction the sale of tear gas rather than bullets? Should arms only be sold to democratic states: in other words, not to dictators? Is this realistic? How can soft power be promoted so that it is more valuable than hard power?</p>
