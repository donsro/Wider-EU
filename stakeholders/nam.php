<h2>NAM</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nam.gov.za/index.html">Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)</a> is an organization of over 100 states which consider themselves not formally aligned with, or against, any major power bloc. The purpose of the organization as stated in the Havana Declaration of 1979 is to ensure <cite>the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries</cite> ... in their ... <cite>struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid, Zionism, racism and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics</cite>. They represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations's members and comprise 55% of the world's population. Important members have included Yugoslavia, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Cuba, Colombia, Venezuela, South Africa, Iran, Malaysia, and, for a time, the People's Republic of China. Brazil has never been a formal member of the movement, but the country shares many of the aims of NAM and frequently sends observers to NAM summits. While the organization was intended to be as close an alliance as NATO or the Warsaw Pact, it has little cohesion and many of its members were closely aligned with one or another of the great powers e.g. Cuba and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War era. India was effectively aligned with the Soviet Union against China for many years. Additionally, some members were involved in serious conflicts with other members (e.g. India and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq). The movement fractured from its own internal contradictions when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. While Soviet allies supported the invasion, other members (particularly the Muslim states) did not. The NAM has struggled to find relevance since the end of the Cold War. The successor states of Yugoslavia, a founding member, have expressed no interest in the NAM since the country's break-up. In 2004, Malta and Cyprus ceased to be members when they joined the European Union.</p>
