<h2>G20</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.g20.org/index.aspx">G20</a> was established in 1999, in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, to bring together major advanced and emerging economies to stabilize the global financial market. It recognised that key emerging market countries were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. The G20 promotes key issues related to global economic stability. It contributes to the strengthening of international financial architecture, and provides opportunities for dialogue on national policies, international cooperation and international financial institutions.</p>
